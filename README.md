How to run

To run these programs, you need to have the relevant programming language compiler or interpreter installed on your machine. For Python, you would need Python 3.x installed. For C++ and CPP, you would need a relevant compiler like GCC, and for Java, you need the Java Development Kit (JDK).

To run a Python script, open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script. Then type:

python filename.py

Replace "filename.py" with the name of the script you wish to run.

The process is similar for other languages. For Java, use javac to compile and java to run. For C++ and CPP, use g++ or an equivalent compiler.
